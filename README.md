However, the current `README.md` file doesn't fully align with the actual project structure and technology stack, likely because it was left outdated. Here's how I can improve it:

### Issues with the Current `README.md`:
1. **Incorrect Backend Technology**: The README mentions **Node.js/Express.js** and **MongoDB**, but the project uses **Laravel** (PHP) and likely **SQLite** (based on the `fix-sqlite-issue.txt` file).
2. **Outdated Frontend Stack**: The README mentions **React.js**, but the `package.json` shows `Vite`, `TailwindCSS`, and `Bootstrap` as the primary frontend tools.
3. **Inconsistent Deployment Guide**: The README suggests **Heroku/Netlify**, but Laravel typically uses **Forge**, **Enviro**, or **shared hosting** with Nginx/Apache.

### Proposed Updates:
1. **Correct the technology stack**.
2. **Simplify the installation guide**.
3. **Add missing details** (e.g., Laravel-specific setup, Vite configuration).
